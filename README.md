# Linear-Regression-Model-to-predict-the-prices-of-the-houses
In this house price prediction project, a Linear Regression model was used with squared and interaction features. The data was standardized, and outliers were removed based on Z-scores. The model's performance was evaluated using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R-squared, and it was also applied to predict prices for new data.
